# Federated Scheduling of Fog-native Applications over Multi-Domain Edge-to-Cloud Ecosystem
Supportive repo of CNSM 2023 paper: Federated Scheduling of Fog-native Applications over Multi-Domain Edge-to-Cloud Ecosystem
## Preliminary on the ecosystem
A metropolitan fog ecosystem may follow the OpenFog reference architecture of [4] and similar strategic definitions, such as [28]. It is a connected set of resources and users, comprised in the minimum of: access gateways (nodes), connecting end-users to the ecosystem; a set of geo-distributed and autonomous edge-cloud data centres and/or clusters (\emph{fog nodes}) of variant capacities; application(s) offered as services over said clouds; and a programmable network that connects all aforementioned parts. Within such an ecosystem, multiple actors of different intents may co-exist and interact: application provider(s), clouds providers(s), network operator(s) and end-user(s). State information sharing is foreseen to be limited by virtue of competitiveness across the different actors in the ecosystem. Edge-cloud clusters and network elements are managed by their respective Management and Orchestration systems (MANOs).
